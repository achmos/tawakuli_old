      <h1>Student Reviews</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at other student's websites in this class, I have seen many things that were good, bad, and some which just didn't make sense. O.o Very weird. Anyway, this is what I've seen in these web pages.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there were two students who had gotten the links for their website and didn't even put it up. I know that Dreamweaver is blocked, but I do believe that 50 Webs has a file manger which you can use if your FTP client doesn't work. So get to the site making!</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing was that three people had, instead of a website with many pages, one web page with three assignments stuffed into it. They were the first three assignments too, so what have they been doing? o.o</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is something on many of the pages. A lot of people don't realize that big bold and italic letters in weird colors doesn't really look right for web pages. It makes their pages displeasing to the eye. The viewer is potential revolted by the look of it, and unless they have a very good reason for being on your site, they aren't going to be there long. So colors, font types, size, and bold and italics should be used when appropriate and when the page actually looks BETTER with them.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing, and just important as the last item, is the thing I call, the dreaded TEXT WRAP!<br />
	X( So you have your website. It looks awesome and everything, people love it. But then, a viewer decides to shrink the browser window to get more room for his MS Word window. All of a sudden, your nice looking page is now reduced to a small window with your web page jumbled up since the browser decided to push all of it in a small space and just put the rest on the next line, to be a nuisance to that line, and the line after that. -.-; That's a bugger, and a hard one first, especially as a beginner. There's a way to fix it, but then some people might not want to go there yet, and I'm pretty sure Mr. Farmer is going to go over it anyway. :)</p>
