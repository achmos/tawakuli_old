	<h3 id="intro"><img src="../../images/hub.gif" alt="Internet Hub"/> Introduction</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet as we know it today wasn't automatically dreamt up, pursued and made into reality just because of the great possibilities it has. &nbsp;The internet came about from a US government research project that was in response to the Soviet Union launching Sputnik 1. &nbsp;Of course, when the country you just happen to be at &quot;war&quot; with makes a technological advancement you didn't foresee, that's enough to wake up any government to get into gear. &nbsp;</p>

	<h3 id="Arpanet"><img src="../../images/hub.gif" alt="Internet Hub"/> ARPANET</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction the government had to the launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was to create an agency to do research for the government. &nbsp;It was called the <span class="internet">Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA</span> (sometimes called <span class="internet">DARPA</span>, the D being Defense). &nbsp;The Agency then went to work by providing funds to the <span class="internet">Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO)</span>. &nbsp;The main point of <span class="internet">ARPANET</span> was to create an information system that could continue functioning in spite of losing any part of the network to a disaster (like say a nuclear bomb! o.o;). &nbsp;So, they tried experimenting with a computer network. &nbsp;They eventually decided that the network would be connected through a packet-switching method. &nbsp;Finally, they put the first nodes at select universities, and <span class="internet">ARPANET</span> was established. &nbsp;From this start, it would go on to be the backbone of the Internet, continuing to expand and grow until 1990, when it was dissolved and <span class="internet">NSFNET</span> took on the responsibility of being the backbone of the internet. &nbsp;</p>
	<hr />
	<h3 id="csnet"><img src="../../images/hub.gif" alt="Internet Hub"/> CSNET</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the foundation of <span class="internet">ARPANET</span>, many universities were not connected to it, mainly cause they were not participating in research for the network. &nbsp;They were aware of it though, and wanted to get connected to it. &nbsp;The plan was to connect non-<span class="internet">ARPANET</span> computer science departments together.&nbsp; To sponsor the project, the <span class="internet">National Science Foundation</span> awarded $5 million to the <span class="internet">CSNET</span> project, as it was called. &nbsp;It was an important event in the history of the internet, for it led to the development of the <span class="internet">NSFNET</span>.&nbsp; </p>
	<hr />
	<h3 id="nfsnet"><img src="../../images/hub.gif" alt="Internet Hub"/> NSFNET</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span class="internet">National Science Foundation</span> involvement in <span class="internet">CSNET</span> helped to propel it into other projects of important's.&nbsp; <span class="internet">NSF</span> eventually launched the Supercomputing Program, to make high performance computers available for research.&nbsp; First funding was given to purchase supercomputers few locations, but later would expand to bring supercomputers to other institutes of notice as well.&nbsp; This entire program was to create a network that would move data twenty-five times faster than the speed of <span class="internet">CSNET</span>, and connect several regional networks.&nbsp; All this was to create a &quot;inter-net&quot;, a &quot;network of networks&quot;, including <span class="internet">ARPANET</span>.&nbsp; In the first year that <span class="internet">NSFNET</span> was up and running, traffic was so great it needed an upgrade.&nbsp; Traffic continued to grow on <span class="internet">NSFNET</span>, that another upgrade was in the works to allow for faster transportation of data.&nbsp; The second upgrade increased the speed thirty-fold, the network expanding so much that its was transferring 1.3 trillion bytes of information per month.&nbsp;</p>
