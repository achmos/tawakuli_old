      <h2 id="A"><img src="../../images/crt.gif" alt="Moniter" /> American</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;American High school's website has a nice distinctive style.&nbsp; There's an eagle in the top left corner, showing the school mascot, and navigation to show much of the websites main features.&nbsp; many things grab my attention that need to be considered.&nbsp; The eagle in the corner, navigation, and the area to display the content of the web page gives a uniform style, but it needs a bit more life to it.&nbsp; Also, the links keep making new windows pop up for the respective pages.&nbsp; Its a bit of a bother since your just looking to browse the entire website through one window, unless you have tabbed browsing going on.&nbsp; So things could be considered in the next renovation of the website.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <div>
	<div style="float: left">
	  <h4>Good Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Distinctive style</li>
	    <li>Use of mascot for page design</li>
	    <li>Navigation to the left</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<div style="float: right">
	  <h4>Bad Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>needs more on the other sides of the pages</li>
	    <li>Links make new windows pop up, which is bothersome</li>

      <h2 id="I"><img src="../../images/crt.gif" alt="Moniter" /> Irvington</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Irvington's website is more of what a website should look like.&nbsp; It isn't to fancy, but it does have a style that fits very well with the information.&nbsp; Presentation of the links also caught my eye, its very well done.&nbsp; One thing though is the blue all over.&nbsp; It must be just the amount of it, since blue kind of puts a bit of a strain on the eyes, and the amount of white could be cut down as well.&nbsp; All in all, a very nice website I must say.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <div>
	<div style="float: left">
	  <h4>Good Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Information organized well and easy to read</li>
	    <li>Links positioned well in respects to the page</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<div style="float: right">
	  <h4>Bad Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Blue color is too vibrate, irritates the eyes</li>
	    <li>Amount of white space could be cut down upon</li>
	  </ul>

      <h2 id="K"><img src="../../images/crt.gif" alt="Moniter" /> Kennedy</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy's site is the most poorly maintained site.&nbsp; A great number of links just take you back to the main page.&nbsp; And the pages that are of use aren't accessible unless you do some poking around.&nbsp; Not to mention on many pages there is really no style or presentation at all, save for a few colored parts of text.&nbsp; The Index though has a nice style.&nbsp; If it could be applied to the rest of the web pages, that would make a great difference.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2 id="M"><img src="../../images/crt.gif" alt="Moniter" /> Mission San Jose</h2>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Missions's website is the best I've seen of the six high schools.&nbsp; The color scheme, organization of links, and use of school colors is very well done.&nbsp; And the information has been organized the best way that I've seen.&nbsp; You actually feel good about reading that much text.&nbsp; I can't find any downsides to the website, although big amount of white space kinda off sets the entire site.&nbsp; Either that, or I just don't like white space much. o.o&nbsp; </p>

	<div style="float: left">
	  <h4>Good Points</h4>

	    <li>Good color scheme</li>

	    <li>Links to web pages fit into the page</li>
	  </ul>

      <h2 id="R"><img src="../../images/crt.gif" alt="Moniter" /> Robertson</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Robertson has nice all-together-ness about its web pages, but the web pages could use more &#8220;filling&#8221; on them.&nbsp; It looks barren.&nbsp; Also, there to much of the normal blue links on the pages, which make a person want to get to a new web page fast.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <div>
	<div style="float: left">
	  <h4>Good Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Site is uniform in design</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<div style="float: right">
	  <h4>Bad Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Needs more &#8220;filling&#8221; on pages</li>
	    <li>Change from regular blue hyperlinks to a different color.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>

      <h2 id="W"><img src="../../images/crt.gif" alt="Moniter" /> Washington</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington High school's website has a uniform look, which is nice and provides a feel for the school.&nbsp; Navigation on the side is done very well, no fancy stuff there, quick, and informative.&nbsp; Things that caught ny eye on the pages were that the information isn't presented in a pleasing way to the eye.&nbsp; Sure its in the right place in respects to organization of the content, but it has an &#8220;ugly&#8221; feeling, so much that you kinda don't feel like reading it.&nbsp; Also some pages weren't finish, but then that's understandable.&nbsp; Maintaining an entire website isn't easy.</p>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <div>
	<div style="float: left">
	  <h4>Good Points</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>uniform and good style</li>

	<div style="float: right">
	  <h4>Bad Points</h4>
	  <ul>
